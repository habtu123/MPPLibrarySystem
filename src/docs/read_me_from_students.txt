The extra credit works that we did are: 
	1. Add a book to the library collection
	2. Given a library member id, print (to console) the checkout record of that library member
	3. Determine whether a given copy of a publication is overdue, and which library member has it in
	his/her possession.
	
 The corresponding sequence diagrams can be found in this folder. 
 
 In addition we used the MVC pattern to organize our project. Under the ui folder, the views (*.fxml) files are 
 put in view folder and their controllers are put under controller folder. 
 
 Custom exception are prepared to handle BookNotFound and UserNotFound exceptions.
